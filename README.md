A hash is a digital fingerprint for information
Hashing function-Maps a group of data to a unique hash value




Data --->Hashing function-->Hash
           (SHA256)
           SHA is the hashing algorithm while 256 is the outcome

Block is a container that holds a list of transactions to be added to the blockchain
Shared digital ledger that records a list of transactions

Blockheader:
*Previous Block hash//It stores the value of the previous hash
*Time//Stores time 
*Merkle Root//Transactions in the forms of hashes are paired and they are again  merged till they get a single value
*Nonce
Block data+Nonce=Hash value

Blockchain 

It is a digital ledger that contains the entire history of transactions made on the network

Mempool
Waiting place for all unconfirmed Transactions before they are added to the blockchain

Consensus 
How the network reaches agreement about which transactions are most trustworthy.
Proof of work
Proof of stake 
DBFT
Pooled mining
A mining approach wherre multipleminers combine resources to mine a block and then 
split the block reward.
Proof of Stake 
It seeks to achieve consensus by giving votes to those with stake in the system.


Who is using it?
Etherum
-Switching from POW to POS in the casper project
DASH
-A pioneer of POS
-Built from the  core bitcoin platform with added features 
for privacy and tx speed

LISK
-Focused on creating Decentralised apps 
-Uses Delegate Proof of Stake 


Delegate Byzantine Fault Tolerance 
Consensus algorithm based on assigning roles to nodes to help coordinate consensus

It has two nodes ordinary node and consensus nodes

It has delegates and a speaker

bitaddress.org is the site to produce private keys.

What is the purpose of a private key?

It generates public key and wallet address that allow us to interact with the blockchain

What makes a private key secure?
It is a 256 bit random number between 1 and 2^256

How to generate a private key?

*Paper,pencil,oil,coin,dice
*OS with sourcce of entropy or library with cryptographic secure number generator
*Entropy
*Websites



Bitaddress.org is the site to generate private keys.
A private key is just a 256 bit random number between 1 and 2^256

Entropy:It is defined as the randomness

Signature: It establishes proof of ownership for
each transaction on the blockchain
